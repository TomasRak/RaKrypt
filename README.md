# RaKrypt - my long-term school project

I started working on this project at the start of school year, september-october 2019. Finished and handed it in in march 2020. What really made me choose this topic was my curiosness of how am i going to implement the logical proceses of all the cyphers into the C# language, and i think it turned out pretty good. Keep in mind that I am a begginer, I know so many things could be done better. I didnt use that much of the OOP but i just wanted to get things done and didnt feel like i needed it. Although looking at it now, i couldve added atleast one class for the cyphering :shit:.

## What RaKrypt actually does?
Its a simple windows forms program that cyphers and decyphers .txt files that the user drops into it. It uses cyphering and decyphering algorithms made by me (@TomasRak). There are also some features like selecting the output folder, user-defined names of the output files and the ability to process many files at once.

### Cyphers included in RaKrypt:
- Caesar
- Vigenèr (+ autokey)
- Vernam
- Affine

## File help
There are multiple folders
- RaKrypt_DMP - the main folder which has all the code, debug and logging files.
- Testovací soubory - the testing .txt files i used to test the program with
- publish - the .exe instalation files used to instal the app on the OS.
